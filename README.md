# Rocksmith 2014 Tab Converter

#### Summary
Exports Rocksmith 2014 arrangements to Guitar Pro (.gp5). It's a command line utility, you have to specify the Rocksmith archive (.psarc) you wish to process and optionally an output directory for the tabs. You can select individual songs from the archive and individual arrangements. By default, all selected arrangements are put into a single file, but you can tell the program to create a separate file for each arrangement.

#### Current version
The current version is v0.9. You can download it at https://github.com/fholger/RocksmithToTab/releases.

#### Basic use

`RocksmithToTab.exe \Path\To\Rocksmith2014\songs.psarc`
Or just drop a .psarc file onto the RocksmithToTab.exe in the explorer.

#### Command line options
```
Usage: RocksmithToTab archive.psarc [-a bass,lead] [-s song1,song2]

  -l, --list      List songs contained in the archive. No conversions are 
                  performed.

  -s, --songs     Comma-separated list of tracks to include. (default: all)

  -a, --arr       Comma-separated list of arrangements to include. (default: 
                  all)

  -t, --split     Create a separate file for each arrangement.

  -d, --diff      (Default: 255) Difficulty level. (default: max)

  -o, --outdir    Path to the directory where tabs should be created. (default:
                  name of the input file minus extension)

  -f, --format    (Default: gp5) File output format, currently either 'gp5', 
                  'gpx' or 'gpif'.

  --help          Display this help screen.

```

#### Results
Some examples of output generated by the program:
![tab1][tab1]
![tab2][tab2]

#### Caveats
* The rhythm detection occasionally screws up, particularly in fast and "sloppy" solos. It may also introduce some weird triplet notes at places you would not expect them. I can't really do too much about that; since Rocksmith deals with absolute time values and doesn't have any information about the intended musical rhythm, the whole process is just guesswork. Most of the output, however, is quite readable.
* Guitar Pro 6 may or may not display more complicated bends correctly. You might have more luck with Guitar Pro 5, but I don't have that version, so I can't test it.
* The program by default lets every note ring until the next one, unless there's more than one silent bar. This means that notes might ring longer than they should. However, since Rocksmith doesn't have any information about pauses, I cannot do anything about it. If a note has a sustain value attached to it, I try my best to honor that sustain and let it ring for as long as it should and (ideally) not much longer.

#### Acknowledgements
Many thanks to the people at www.rscustom.net for creating the Rocksmith Custom Toolkit, without which this exporter would not have been possible. Likewise, I'd probably never have started this project if I didn't have the code from the [RSTabExplorer](https://github.com/andulv/RSTabExplorer) project as a starting point!
