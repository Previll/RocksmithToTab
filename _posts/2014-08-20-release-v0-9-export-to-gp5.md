title: New release v0.9 brings export to Guitar Pro 5!
---

RocksmithToTab v0.9 is out, and it's a pretty exciting release! The major new feature is export to the Guitar Pro 5 format, .gp5. This means that all of you who don't own the current Guitar Pro 6, but only its predecessor, can now use the program to generate compatible tabs from Rocksmith. Also, the gp5 file format has excellent support in TuxGuitar, the free open source alternative to Guitar Pro.

### Changelog

* Added export to the Guitar Pro 5 (.gp5) file format.
* Fixed a bug where some notes were incorrectly sustained into the next bar, even though the bar didn't begin with a pause.
* Several other minor bugfixes.

### Download

You can [download this release][dl] from GitHub.
