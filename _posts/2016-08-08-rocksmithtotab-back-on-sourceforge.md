title: RocksmithToTab back on SourceForge
---

Hi everyone,

as some of you noticed, the download links for the latest version of RocksmithToTab are down due to the hoster FossHub suffering a security breach on August 2nd. You can read the details [here][reddit]. 

As a consequence, I have uploaded RocksmithToTab v1.1 on [SourceForge][dl].
