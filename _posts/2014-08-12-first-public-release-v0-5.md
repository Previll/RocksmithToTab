title: First public release v0.5
---

I'm excited to present the first public release of RocksmithToTab, a tool to extract tablature from Rocksmith 2014 arrangements. It already supports quite of few of Rocksmith's features, the most notable missing features are bends and sustains. They will be added soon. The tabs are exported into the Guitar Pro 6 (.gpx) file format. You can open them with Guitar Pro 6 or with special versions of TuxGuitar that support the gpx format.

### Download

You can [download this release][dl] from GitHub.
