title: New release v0.8 features improved rhythm detection
---

I released RocksmithToTab v0.8. New in this version is an improved rhythm detection algorithm that should result in more accurate rhythm notation. However, do expect that there may still be the occasional weird or simply incorrect note value appearing, particularly in fast solos. It's impossible to prevent that entirely, but I do my best.

### Changelog

* Improved rhythm detection.
* Fixed a bug where some chords had incorrect or missing notes.

### Download

You can [download this release][dl] from GitHub.
